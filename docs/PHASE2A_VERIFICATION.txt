Phase 2a — Verification Checklist
===================================
Test Date: 2026-02-17 (updated after second test round)

Feature                          Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mob detection (hostile)          WORKING — zombies, spiders, creepers, drowned
"blocks" not "meters"            WORKING — "Spider nearby, like 7 blocks"
Bot identity (my HP vs player)   MOSTLY FIXED — sometimes still says "you" for itself
Health alerts (drop-only)        WORKING — no spam, fires on actual drops only
Night fall / dawn                WORKING — both fired correctly
Weather change                   WORKING — rain + clear detected
Player join                      WORKING
Player death                     WORKING — "I just got clapped"
Mob spawn (entitySpawn)          WORKING — spider at 7, zombie at 14
Creeper proximity (<8 blocks)    WORKING — creeper at 6 blocks detected
Inventory in game state          WORKING — "I see cooked chicken in my inv"
Player detection                 WORKING — JaxieJ in passives
Biome detection                  FIXED — was passing float coords, now uses .floored()
Bot eating                       FIXED — [ACTION:eat] equips food + consumes
Player action awareness          MISSING — can't see player killing/mining/etc
Biome change event               READY — depends on biome fix (now fixed), needs retest
Item pickup (notable)            UNTESTED — no notable items picked up yet
Potion effects                   UNTESTED — no potions used

Phase 2b Combat AI               IMPLEMENTED — needs testing on normal difficulty
  Auto-defend on hit             IMPLEMENTED — entityHurt → nearest hostile → attack/flee
  attack_mob action              IMPLEMENTED — [ACTION:attack_mob:zombie]
  flee action                    IMPLEMENTED — [ACTION:flee] paths to player
  stop_attack action             IMPLEMENTED — [ACTION:stop_attack]
  Creeper flee logic             IMPLEMENTED — always flee, never melee
  Low HP flee                    IMPLEMENTED — HP <= 6 → auto-flee
  under_attack event             IMPLEMENTED — 15s cooldown
  mob_killed event               IMPLEMENTED — 10s cooldown

Remaining Issues:
1. Player awareness: bot can't see player actions (fighting, mining, building) — future phase
